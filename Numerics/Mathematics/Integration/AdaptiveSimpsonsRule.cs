    /// Adaptive Simpson's rule uses an estimate of the error that comes from calculating a definite integral with Simpson's rule. If the error between the previous
    /// evaluation of the rule and the current evaluation of the rule exceeds a certain specified tolerance, the rule calls for subdividing the interval. Adaptive Simpson's
    /// rule is applied to each subinterval in a recursive manner until the error qualifications are met.

    ///             | S(a, b) - S(a, m) + S(m, b) | &lt; epsilon
